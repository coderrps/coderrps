## 📂 Featured Projects

### 1. [Mental Health Advisor](https://github.com/coderrps/mental-health-advisor)
The Mental Health Advisor is an interactive web application designed to assess mental well-being through a series of tailored questions. Using a dynamic question-and-response interface, it collects user inputs and provides personalized advice based on their answers. The application aims to offer insightful guidance and support, helping users better understand their mental health and encouraging proactive measures for well-being.

### 2. [Netflix App](https://github.com/coderrps/netflix-app)
The Netflix recommendation system is an advanced algorithm that personalizes content suggestions for each user based on their viewing history, ratings, and preferences. It combines collaborative and content-based filtering with machine learning to predict and recommend movies, TV shows, and documentaries tailored to individual tastes. The system continuously learns from user interactions, ensuring relevant and engaging recommendations, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

### 3. [Alziehmer Disease Detection Model](https://github.com/coderrps/AD_Capstone_Code)
The Alzheimer's Disease Detection Model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and predict Alzheimer's disease from medical imaging and patient data. CNNs are employed to extract features from brain scans, identifying patterns associated with the disease, while RNNs handle sequential data, such as patient history, to improve prediction accuracy. This combined approach enhances early detection and diagnosis, aiding in timely intervention and personalized treatment plans.
